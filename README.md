### _Cloning and Initial Setup_

> Repository: 
1. In your terminal of choice or [GitHub's Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) , clone the above repository from Github. For further explanation on how to clone this repository, please visit [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).
2. Ensure you are running .NET Core SDK by using the command dotnet --version in your terminal. If a version number is not presented, please visit [this download page for .NET 5 and install the applicable software for your OS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0). 
3. Once you verify you are running a .NET 5, navigate in your terminal to Recipe directory within the Recipe-box directory you just cloned. Once there, run "dotnet build" in your terminal to build application within directory. 
4. In your terminal, while still in Recipe directory, run "dotnet restore."
5. You will require a text or code editor to complete the following steps. [VS Code is recommended](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


### _Installation: Database Recreation_

1. Ensure you are running MySQL Server 8 and MySQL WorkBench 8. If you are running windows, use the [Windows Installer ](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) for MySQL and follow the instructions provided by the installer. For Macs, visit [MySQL Commuinity Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and select macOS from the Operation Systems. This will be a manual installation. If you need additonal assistance on this, please visit Epicodus's [Learn How to Program Article](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
2. Once you verify you have SQL installed, create a file called "appsettings.json" in the root directory Recipe-box. Paste the following into this file.
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port={PORT OF SERVER};database=recipe-box;uid=root;pwd={PASSWORD OF SERVER};"
  }
}
```
3. In your terminal, run "dotnet ef database update"
### _Installation: General Use_

1. Back in your terminal in the Recipe production directory, type "dotnet run." The terminal will present local host routes for you to navigate to in your browser. An example would be "http://localhost:5000." Enter this into a web browser of choice to use this application. Keep the terminal running as it is being used to control the local server.
2. When finished, exit the terminal or use the command "CTRL C"(Windows) or "CMD C"(Mac) to shut down the local server.
